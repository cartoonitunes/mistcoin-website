## What is MistCoin?

MistCoin was deployed by the Ethereum Foundation's Mist team as a prototype to test standardized token creation. The Mist Browser (Ethereum's official dApp browser) shipped a "Custom Tokens" feature in Wallet Beta 3 (October 30, 2015), and MistCoin was deployed as the reference token for that feature. Sixteen days later, Vitalik Buterin and Fabian Vogelsteller formally proposed the ERC-20 standard (EIP-20), which codified the token interface that MistCoin had already implemented.

## Why is MistCoin historically significant?

Every ERC-20 token on Ethereum — hundreds of thousands of tokens representing hundreds of billions of dollars in value — follows the standard that MistCoin prototyped. MistCoin is the oldest surviving token that implements the core ERC-20 interface (balanceOf, transfer, Transfer event).
